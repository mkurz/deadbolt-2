h1. Deadbolt 2 - An authorisation system for Play 2

Deadbolt is an authorisation mechanism for defining access rights to certain controller methods or parts of a view using a simple AND/OR/NOT syntax.

Note that Deadbolt doesn't provide authentication!  You can use the existing authentication features of Play 2, or third-party modules such as SecureSocial alongside Deadbolt to provide authentication, and in cases where authentication is handled outside your app you can just hook up the authorisation mechanism to whatever auth system is used.


h2. Configuration

Implement DeadboltHandler.  Update your application.conf to have

bc. deadbolt.handler=fully-qualified name of your implementation

Deadbolt doesn't cache the role holder within the same request by default.  You can enable this (typically with performance benefits) by add this to application.conf

bc. deadbolt.cache-user=true

h3. A note on contexts

This issue was reported in github by jblipphaus:
When getting a result through my DeadboltHandler I recognized, that the current Http.Context seems to "get lost", for example the @Messages("foo") call does not work any longer. So I had to add the following to the DeadboltHandler in my project:

bc. public Result onAccessFailure(Http.Context context, String s) {
    Http.Context.current.set(context); // <-- this is needed to have a current Http.Context
    return ok(views.html.index.render());
}

The same with the 'beforeRoleCheck' method.

h2. Installing Deadbolt

At the moment, there is no open repository for Play 2 modules, so Deadbolt 2 is hosted on github.  You will
need to update the Build.scala of your application to add a repository resolver for this.

The dependency declaration is

bc. "be.objectify" %% "deadbolt-2" % "1.1.2"

The Build.scala then looks like

bc.. object ApplicationBuild extends Build {

        val appName         = "deadbolt-usage"
        val appVersion      = "1.1.2"

        val appDependencies = Seq(
          "deadbolt-2" %% "deadbolt-2" % "1.1.2"
        )

        val main = PlayProject(appName, appVersion, appDependencies, mainLang = JAVA).settings(
          resolvers += Resolver.url("Objectify Play Repository", url("http://schaloner.github.com/releases/"))(Resolver.ivyStylePatterns)
        )
}

h2. The Deadbolt plugin

Deadbolt requires its plugin to be declared in the conf/play.plugins file.  If this file doesn't exist (it's not created by default when you create a new project),
just create it in the conf directory first, and then add

bc. 10000:be.objectify.deadbolt.DeadboltPlugin


h2. Controller restrictions

NB Method-level annotations override controller-level annotations.  All controller restrictions can be applied at the
controller level or method level.

*Name* Dynamic
*Used for* arbitrary security.  Requires an implementation of a DynamicResourceHandler, accessible through the DeadboltHandler
*Parameters*
* value - the resource name
* meta - additional info passed into the DynamicResourceHandler at runtime
* content - indicates the response format in case of access failure
* handler - a specific DeadboltHandler to use for this restriction, which overrides the application-standard handler

*Examples*

bc. @Dynamic("foo", "hurdy:gurdy")

bc. @Dynamic(name="foo", meta="hurdy:gurdy", content="json", handler=my.special.FunkyDeadboltHandler)


*Name* Restrict
*Used for* static security.  Requires an implementation of a RoleHolder, accessible through the DeadboltHandler.  Role names are ANDed together.
*Parameters*
* value - the ANDed role names
* content - indicates the response format in case of access failure
* handler - a specific DeadboltHandler to use for this restriction, which overrides the application-standard handler

*Examples*

bc. @Restrict("foo") // restricts access to RoleHolders with the foo role

bc. @Restrict({"foo", "bar"}) // restricts access to RoleHolders with both the foo and bar roles


*Name* Restrictions
*Used for* static security.  Requires an implementation of a RoleHolder, accessible through the DeadboltHandler.  Role names are ANDed together within And annotations, and ORed together between And annotations.
*Parameters*
* value - the restriction combinations
* content - indicates the response format in case of access failure
* handler - a specific DeadboltHandler to use for this restriction, which overrides the application-standard handler

*Examples*

bc. @Restrictions({@And("foo"), @And("bar")}) // restricts access to RoleHolders with either the foo or bar roles


*Name* Unrestricted
*Used for* Marks the resource as unrestricted - no role checking, or presence of a role holder, is required
*Parameters*
* content - indicates the response format in case of access failure
* handler - a specific DeadboltHandler to use for this restriction, which overrides the application-standard handler

*Examples*

bc. @Unrestricted


*Name* RoleHolderPresent
*Used for* Marks the resource as restricted, but only to logged-in users
*Parameters*
* content - indicates the response format in case of access failure
* handler - a specific DeadboltHandler to use for this restriction, which overrides the application-standard handler

*Examples*

bc. @RoleHolderPresent


*Name* RoleHolderNotPresent
*Used for* Marks the resource as restricted, but only to not-logged-in users
*Parameters*
* content - indicates the response format in case of access failure
* handler - a specific DeadboltHandler to use for this restriction, which overrides the application-standard handler

*Examples*

bc. @RoleHolderNotPresent


*Name* DeadboltPattern
*Used for* Evaluating exact matches, regular expressions or custom values against user permissions
*Parameters*
* value - the pattern
* patternType - indicates the type of pattern, either EQUALITY, REGEX or CUSTOM.  EQUALITY is the default value.
* content - indicates the response format in case of access failure
* handler - a specific DeadboltHandler to use for this restriction, which overrides the application-standard handler

*Examples*
bc. @DeadboltPattern("(.)*\\.edit")

Notes:
* Regular expressions are cached for efficiency

h2. View restrictions

If you don't want to use the full namespace of the tags, you can import some or all of them in your template.

@import be.objectify.deadbolt.views.html._


*Name* restrict
*Used for* static security.  This is the view equivalent of @Restrictions.
*Parameters*
* roles - a List of String arrays.  Roles within an array are ANDed together; Each array represents an OR.

*Examples*

bc. @restrict(la(as("foo"))) {
   foo
 }

Notes:
 As a convenience to create the lists and arrays, you can import the methods of TemplateUtils and use the following methods
  - la - create a list of arrays
  - as - create an array of strings
 You can see this used in the example above.  A more detailed example is

bc. @deadbolt.restrict(la(as("foo"),as("bar"))) {
  foo
 }

You can import these methods into your templates with @import be.objectify.deadbolt.utils.TemplateUtils._


*Name* dynamic
*Used for* arbitrary security.  This is the view equivalent of @Dynamic
*Parameters*
* name - the resource name
* meta - additional info passed into the DynamicResourceHandler at runtime

*Examples*

bc. @dynamic("foo") {
  foo
 }

bc. @dynamic("bar", "hurdy:gurdy") {
  bar
 }


*Name* roleHolderPresent
*Used for* ensuring the viewer is logged in.  This is the view equivalent of @RoleHolderPresent
*Parameters*
* name - the resource name
* meta - additional info passed into the DynamicResourceHandler at runtime

*Examples*

bc. @roleHolderPresent {
  foo
 }


*Name* roleHolderNotPresent
*Used for* ensuring the viewer is not logged in.  This is the view equivalent of @RoleHolderNotPresent
*Parameters*
* name - the resource name
* meta - additional info passed into the DynamicResourceHandler at runtime

*Examples*

bc. @roleHolderNotPresent {
  foo
 }


*Name* deadboltPattern
*Used for* checking exact matches, regexs or custom values against user permissions.  This is the view equivalent of @DeadboltPattern
*Parameters*
* value - the pattern value
* patternType - the pattern type, e.g. EQUALITY, REGEX, CUSTOM

*Examples*

bc. @deadboltPattern("(.)*\\.edit") {
  foo
 }

bc. @deadboltPattern("(.)*\\.edit", PatternType.REGEX) {
  foo
 }


*Note* There is no tag equivalent of @Unrestricted
